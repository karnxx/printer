## 10/9/2025 - decided idea  

# Idea: Infinity conveyor printer

I wanna make my own 3D printer that can print forever, kinda like the [Creality CR-30](https://www.creality.com/fr/products/creality-cr-30-3d-printer).  
I also want it to have an AMS so it can switch between colors or materials automatically.

Hi! so i started with researching about the printer. so what im gonna do is follow a corexy xy thing from my other printers. and for the conveyor, the heatbed im gonna be using will be 235x235. so the conveyor will move by 2 cylindrical thingeys, one of them controlled by a nema17hs4401. im gonna make the frame using 2020 alu extrusion. anyways, the headbed will be placed a bit higher than the conveyor cylinders.
i need to research about the conveyor belt material and stuff, and also about the firmware.

so smtn like this. cylinder should be 3d printed. and it uses gt2 belt and motor has 12t pulley, and the cylinder has a pulley with 60t, effectively giving us a 5:1 gear reduction between the motor and the conveyor roller.
