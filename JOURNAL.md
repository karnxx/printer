## 10/9/2025 - decided idea  

# Idea: Infinity conveyor printer

I wanna make my own 3D printer that can print forever, kinda like the [Creality CR-30](https://www.creality.com/fr/products/creality-cr-30-3d-printer).  
I also want it to have an AMS so it can switch between colors or materials automatically.

## 11/1/2025 - started with the design  

Hi! so i started with researching about the printer. so what im gonna do is follow a corexy xy thing from my other printers. and for the conveyor, the heatbed im gonna be using will be 235x235. so the conveyor will move by 2 cylindrical thingeys, one of them controlled by a nema17hs4401. im gonna make the frame using 2020 alu extrusion. anyways, the headbed will be placed a bit higher than the conveyor cylinders.
i need to research about the conveyor belt material and stuff, and also about the firmware.
