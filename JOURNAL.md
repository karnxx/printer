## 10/9/2025 - decided idea  

# Idea: Infinity conveyor printer

I wanna make my own 3D printer that can print forever, kinda like the [Creality CR-30](https://www.creality.com/fr/products/creality-cr-30-3d-printer).  
I also want it to have an AMS so it can switch between colors or materials automatically.
