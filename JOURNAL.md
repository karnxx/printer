## 10/9/2025 - decided idea  

# Idea: Infinity conveyor printer

I wanna make my own 3D printer that can print forever, kinda like the [Creality CR-30](https://www.creality.com/fr/products/creality-cr-30-3d-printer).  
I also want it to have an AMS so it can switch between colors or materials automatically.

## 11/1/2025 4 PM - started with the design  

Hi! so i started with researching about the printer. so what im gonna do is follow a corexy xy thing from my other printers. and for the conveyor, the heatbed im gonna be using will be 235x235. so the conveyor will move by 2 cylindrical thingeys, one of them controlled by a nema17hs4401. im gonna make the frame using 2020 alu extrusion. anyways, the headbed will be placed a bit higher than the conveyor cylinders.
i need to research about the conveyor belt material and stuff, and also about the firmware.

## 11/1/2025 5 PM - research  

researched about belt:

so smtn like this. cylinder should be 3d printed. and it uses gt2 belt and motor has 12t pulley, and the cylinder has [a pulley with 60t](https://robocraze.com/products/aluminum-gt2-6mm-belt-width-60-teeth-5mm-bore-aluminium-timing-pulley?variant=43139553525984&country=IN&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&campaignid=22271813913&adgroupid=&keyword=&device=c&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22271815110&gbraid=0AAAAADgHQvbI3gbBQCQVnnvqsMlc8K5P3&gclid=Cj0KCQjw35bIBhDqARIsAGjd-cYDuq2QhIYNGwBTYZfFevpRrVqZvKxGKS0WDxswsrQR2y5qEAqQMY8aAod3EALw_wcB
), effectively giving us a 5:1 gear reduction between the motor and the conveyor roller. and if we have to join belts, [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhwb8rjqt5A) is excellent.
  

## 11/2/2025 - 3d modelling  

hello! here i have understood more about the printer by actually making the 3d model. here is what it looks like for now.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzY2NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d9b1637935c847281d56edff26d405b670f6a24a/image.png)
we will have 2 3d printed cylinders, 300mm long (maybe 1 or 2 mm more) with a 7.9mm hole in the centre. so we wil fit a linear rod through that hole. we will put the 60t pulley in that rod. also at the end of those, we will have kfl08 bearings.

the blue thing is the heatbed, which is 300x300mm. i also need to modify the toolhead.

after making the conveyor i will start designing the 3d printed parts. for now im done with these stands

## 11/3/2025 - pulley system.  

i started making some of the 3d printed parts.

very basic design

here i designed the xy system, the xy gantry thing, the xy motor mounts and the pulley bracket thing.
